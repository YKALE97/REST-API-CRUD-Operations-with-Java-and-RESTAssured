REST API CRUD Operations with Java and RESTAssured
This repository contains an automated script developed in Java using the RESTAssured API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a fake API provided by https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. This script enables you to interact with the API and test the endpoints effectively.

Project Description
In this project, I have created an automated script that utilizes the RESTAssured library to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API. The script is designed to demonstrate the basic CRUD operations:

Create: The script sends a POST request to create a new resource.
Read: It makes GET requests to retrieve data from the API.
Update: PUT requests are used to modify existing resources.
Delete: DELETE requests are sent to remove resources.
Features
CRUD Operations: The script allows you to perform all CRUD operations on the JSONPlaceholder API.
Automated Testing: It automates the testing process, providing a fast and reliable way to validate the API's functionality.
Flexible and Extensible: You can use this script as a foundation for testing other REST APIs by modifying the endpoints and payloads.
Getting Started
To access the complete project and run the automated script in Eclipse, you can download and explore the Eclipse project provided in this repository.

How to Use
Download the Eclipse project from this repository.
Open the project in Eclipse.
Run the script to perform CRUD operations on the JSONPlaceholder API.
Observe the results and customize the script as needed for your specific API testing requirements.
